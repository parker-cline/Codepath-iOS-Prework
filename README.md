# Pre-work - *The Tip Handyman*

**The Tip Handyman** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Parker Cline**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added a settings screen.
- [x] Added an option in the settings screen to change the tip percentage for the three segments.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The biggest challenge I faced was opening the Assistant Editor. The Add Editor button on the top right was seemingly disabled so I wasn't able to click on it. To overcome this obstacle, I researched the problem on StackOverflow and realized Xcode was in "focused mode"--finding the hotkey to disable focused mode so I could click on the button.
